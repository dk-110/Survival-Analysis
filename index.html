<p>This interactive plot visualizes patient-level survival data from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) clinical dataset for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Each dot represents an individual patient, with survival time in years on the x-axis and treatment outcome on the y-axis. The color indicates gender, and hovering over each point reveals details like gender, survival duration, and outcome. The plot includes patients with reported outcomes like Complete Response and Progressive Disease, as well as those with missing or unreported treatment outcomes, labeled as Not Reported. This inclusion gives a more realistic view of clinical data, highlighting that not all cases are fully documented. Overall, the plot reveals that patients with a complete response generally live longer, while those with progressive disease tend to have shorter survival. By combining interactivity with demographic context, this visualization offers an engaging way to explore how treatment outcomes relate to patient survival in real-world AML cases.</p>
