This interactive plot below visualizes clinical data from patients diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) a type of blood cancer. Each dot on the graph represents an individual patient.\n\nX-axis: Survival time (years)\nY-axis: Treatment outcome (Complete Response, Unknown, or Not Reported)\n\nDot Color: Gender of the patient\n\nThe treatment outcomes include:\n\nComplete Response – meaning the patient responded well to treatment\nUnknown – outcome is unclear or ambiguous\nNot Reported – outcome data is missing from the medical record\n\nThe plot helps identify patterns in survival patients with a “Complete Response” often show longer survival durations, while those with “Unknown” or “Not Reported” outcomes tend to have more scattered or shorter survival times.\n\nReminder The presence of missing data highlights challenges in analyzing real-world clinical datasets, where not every case is fully documented.\n\n\n\nSurvival Analysis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients by Treatment Outcome"

I chose to explore survival analysis as part of my journey into understanding complex biological and clinical data particularly in the context of cancer research.\nThis website showcases an analysis of real-world clinical data from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients, using statistical methods and interactive plots to visualize survival trends and treatment outcomes. By combining my background in life sciences with data analytics, I aim to bridge the gap between biology and data-driven insights.\n\nContact\n📧 darakhshan.fatima110@gmail.com\n🐙 GitHub: dk-110\n🎓 Course Homepage: Kane’s Free Data Science Bootcamp"
