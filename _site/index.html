Project Summary
</h2>
<p>The clinical data used in this project was obtained from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), a comprehensive platform managed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) that provides open access to cancer genomics datasets. This interactive plot below visualizes clinical data from patients diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) a type of blood cancer. Each dot on the graph represents an individual patient.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>X-axis</strong>: Survival time (years)</li>
<li><strong>Y-axis</strong>: Treatment outcome (<em>Complete Response</em>, <em>Unknown</em>, or <em>Not Reported</em>)<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Dot Color</strong>: Gender of the patient</li>
</ul>
<p>The treatment outcomes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Complete Response</strong> – meaning the patient responded well to treatment</li>
<li><strong>Unknown</strong> – outcome is unclear or ambiguous</li>
<li><strong>Not Reported</strong> – outcome data is missing from the medical record</li>
</ul>
<p>The plot helps identify patterns in survival patients with a “Complete Response” often show longer survival durations, while those with “Unknown” or “Not Reported” outcomes tend to have more scattered or shorter survival times.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reminder</strong> The presence of missing data highlights challenges in analyzing real-world clinical datasets, where not every case is fully documented.</li>
</ul>
