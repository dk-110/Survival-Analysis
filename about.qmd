Hi! I'm Darakhshan Fatima, and I hold a Master’s degree in Zoology. I chose to explore survival analysis as part of my journey into understanding complex biological and clinical data particularly in the context of cancer research. 

This website showcases an analysis of real-world clinical data from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients, using statistical methods and interactive plots to visualize survival trends and treatment outcomes. By combining my background in life sciences with data analytics, I aim to bridge the gap between biology and data-driven insights.
