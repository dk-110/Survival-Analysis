I chose to explore survival analysis as part of my journey into understanding complex biological and clinical data particularly in the context of cancer research.\nThis website showcases an analysis of real-world clinical data from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients, using statistical methods and interactive plots to visualize survival trends and treatment outcomes. By combining my background in life sciences with data analytics, I aim to bridge the gap between biology and data-driven insights.\n\nContact\nüìß darakhshan.fatima110@gmail.com\nüêô GitHub: dk-110\nüìÅ Project Repository: Survival-Analysis\nüéì Course Homepage: Kane‚Äôs Free Data Science Bootcamp"

    "text": "Project Summary\n\nIn this project, we analyzed clinical data from 429 patients diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) a type of blood cancer. The dataset was obtained from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) a comprehensive platform maintained by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) that provides open access to cancer genomics datasets.\n\n\nNumber of Patients by Treatment Outcome and Gender\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Outcome\nFemale\nMale\nTotal Patients\n\n\n\n\nNot Reported\n128\n116\n244\n\n\nComplete Response\n59\n80\n139\n\n\nUnknown\n30\n16\n46\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore visualizing survival outcomes, we included a summary table that displays the total number of patients by treatment outcome and gender. This table helps contextualize the distribution of treatment responses across male and female patients, while also highlighting the prevalence of missing or unreported treatment outcomes‚Äîa common challenge in analyzing real-world clinical datasets.\n\nSurvival Analysis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients by Treatment Outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The interactive plot above visualizes clinical data from patients diagnosed with AML.\n\nEach Dot: Represents an individual patient\nDot Color: Gender of the patient\n\nX-axis: Survival time (years)\nY-axis: Treatment outcome (Complete Response, Unknown, or Not Reported)\n\nThe treatment outcomes include:\n\nComplete Response ‚Äì meaning the patient responded well to treatment\nUnknown ‚Äì outcome is unclear or ambiguous\nNot Reported ‚Äì outcome data is missing from the medical record\n\nThe plot helps identify patterns in survival patients with a ‚ÄúComplete Response‚Äù often show longer survival durations, while those with ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù or ‚ÄúNot Reported‚Äù outcomes tend to have more scattered or shorter survival times.\n\nReminder The presence of missing data highlights challenges in analyzing real-world clinical datasets, where not every case is fully documented."
